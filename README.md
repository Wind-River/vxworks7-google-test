Google Test support for VxWorks速 7
===
---

# Overview

The Google Test support for VxWorks速 7 provides the makefiles and source 
files derived form https://github.com/google/googletest and VxWorks layer
configuration files to buid google test to a static library. The static 
library can be linked to DKM and RTP to support the google test framwork.

# Project License

The source code for this project is provided under the BSD 3-Clause "New" or 
"Revised" License A permissive license similar to the BSD 2-Clause License, 
but with a 3rd clause that prohibits others from using the name of the project
or its contributors to promote derived products without written consent.
Text for the Goolge Test dependencies and other applicable license notices can
be found in the License_Notices.txt file in the project top level directory. 
Different files may be under different licenses. Each source file should 
include a license notice that designates the licensing terms for the respective
file.

# Prerequisite(s)

* Install the Wind River速 VxWorks速 7 operating system version SR0610 or later.

* The build system will need to download source code from github.com.  A
  working Internet connection with access to both sites is required.

* Install the git tool and ensure it oeprates from the command line.

### Setup

1. Download the **vxworks7-google-test Private* from the following location:

   https://github.com/Wind-River/vxworks7-google-test

2. Set WIND_LAYER_PATHS to point to the vxworks7-google-test directory. 
Command-line users may set this directly using export on Linux or set on 
Windows. Developers working on a Microsoft Windows host may also set the system
environment variables. On Microsoft Windows 10, these can be found in the 
Control Panel under View advanced system Settings. Click the "Advanced" tab to
find the "Environment Variables" button. From here you may set WIND_LAYER_PATHS
to point to the vxworks7-google-test. Please refer to the VxWorks 
documentation for details on the WIND_LAYER_PATHS variable.

2. Confirm the layer is present in your VxWorks 7 installation. In a VxWorks 
development shell, you may run "vxprj vsb listAll" and look for GTEST_1_8_0_0
to confirm that the layer has been found.


## Creating the VSB and VIP Using WrTool

Create the VxWorks 7 VxWorks source build (VSB) and VxWorks image project (VIP) using either the Wind River Workbench environment or the command line tool **WrTool**. This procedure uses the *vxsim_linux* board support package (BSP) as an example.  

1. Set the environment variable and change the directory.

        export WIND_WRTOOL_WORKSPACE=$HOME/WindRiver/workspace   
        cd $WIND_WRTOOL_WORKSPACE

2. Create the VSB using the **WrTool**.

        wrtool prj vsb create -force -bsp vxsim_linux myVSB -S
        cd myVSB
        wrtool prj vsb config -w -add _WRS_CONFIG_GTEST=y
        make -j[jobs]  
        cd ..

3. Create the VIP using the **WrTool**.

        wrtool prj vip create -force -vsb myVSB -profile PROFILE_STANDALONE_DEVELOPMENT vxsim_linux llvm myVIP
        cd myVIP
        wrtool prj vip component add INCLUDE_GTEST
        cd ..


## Build RTP project with gtest library

1.  In your RTP project, create a .cc file and write down your test code. 
    No need to add test entry for RTP, compiler will generate one automatically.

2.  Build Properties->Libraries, Add "-l ${VSB_DIR}/usr/*/common/libgtest.a". 

3.  Build your RTP project.


## Build DKM project with gtest library

1.  Create a DKM project, add .cc file and write down your test code. Add the test entry in your .cc file. 

        int main()
        {
            int argc = 1;
            char *argv = (char *)"your dkm binary path, empty string also works";
            ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, &argv);
            return RUN_ALL_TESTS_AND_UNLOAD_SELF();
        }
   
2.  Add libgtest.a to DKM Project properties -> build properties -> Libraries
        -L $(VSB_DIR)/krnl/SIMLINUX/common
        -l gtest

3.  Build your DKM project.


The namespace in kernel isn't isolated between different dkms, Only one google test instance is allowed 
to exist at the same time. The current dkm has to be unloaded for the next one to work properly.
Two help functions GTEST_UNLOAD_SELF and RUN_ALL_TESTS_AND_UNLOAD_SELF are provided to
replace the  RUN_ALL_TESTS. The purpose is unload the dkm itself.
There are two style in function main depending on if the test rusult is return

a. Return with getting the testing result.

        int main()
        {
            int argc = 1;
            char *argv = (char *)"your dkm binary path, empty string also works";
            ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, &argv);
            ret = RUN_ALL_TESTS()
            if(ret>0)
            do some work ;
            return GTEST_UNLOAD_SELF();
        }
 
b.  Return without getting the testing result.

        int main()
        {
            int argc = 1;
            char *argv = (char *)"your dkm binary path, empty string also works";
            ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, &argv);
            return RUN_ALL_TESTS_AND_UNLOAD_SELF();
        }
