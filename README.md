   https://github.com/Wind-River/vxworks7-google-test

2. Set WIND_LAYER_PATHS to point to the vxworks7-google-test directory. 
Command-line users may set this directly using export on Linux or set on 
Windows. Developers working on a Microsoft Windows host may also set the system
environment variables. On Microsoft Windows 10, these can be found in the 
Control Panel under View advanced system Settings. Click the "Advanced" tab to
find the "Environment Variables" button. From here you may set WIND_LAYER_PATHS
to point to the vxworks7-layers-for-opencv. Please refer to the VxWorks 
documentation for details on the WIND_LAYER_PATHS variable.

2. Confirm the layer is present in your VxWorks 7 installation. In a VxWorks 
development shell, you may run "vxprj vsb listAll" and look for GTEST_1_8_0_0
to confirm that the layer has been found.
